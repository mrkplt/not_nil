not_nil?
========

----------
This gem adds a ```not_nil?``` method to ```Object```. Yes, it's exactly the same as ```!object.nil?```, and as a matter of fact that is exactly what it does. It's just some syntactic sugar.

It's probably dangerous in some way I don't fully understand. If you see something please let me know.
