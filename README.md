not_nil?
========

----------
This gem adds a ```not_nil?``` method to ```Object```. Yes, it's exactly the same as ```!object.nil?```, and as a matter of fact that is exactly what it does. It's just some syntactic sugar.

Since it has been asked repeatedly over the years: I made this gem to annoy another developer, not because of any technical need.
